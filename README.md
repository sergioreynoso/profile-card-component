## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - Bundler

### What I learned

I learn how to use the background-images, background-size, and background-position properties, as well as working with multiple background images.

```css
background-image: url(../images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
  url(../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
background-repeat: no-repeat, no-repeat;
background-size: 61.125rem, 61.125rem;
background-position: top -31.9375rem left -17.9375rem, bottom -39.4375rem
    right -14.4375rem;
```

### Continued development

I would like to explore how to make the background images responsive (size, x and y) to the viewport width. I believe this would be a great opportunity to use the min() or max() functions, and possibly the clamp() function as well.
